# Autonomous-truck

This is a repository of my University project, which was created with .NET C#, Unity and Blender (for modeling). </br>
The main idea was to create a fairly simple algorithm, which would allow the vehicle (or robot, or anything) to avoid obstacles autonomously using sensors. </br>
The solution I came up with was not too sophisticated, but it did a decent job. I enjoyed focusing on the visual part of the project. </br>
Truck controller and camera control scripts can be found in the Assets->Scripts. </br>
